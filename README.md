# PQOne-AI-Assist
An AI-powered assistant for analyzing PQ ONE power quality reports.

**HiokiAssist** is an AI-powered assistant designed to help users analyze and understand power quality (PQ) reports generated by Hioki’s **PQ ONE** software.  
It runs fully offline with local LLM support and provides smart summarization, trend analysis, and technical Q&A in a simple chat interface.

##  Project Background

PQ ONE reports contain detailed data on voltage dips, harmonics, transients, RVC, and more — but many users struggle to extract key insights quickly.

**HiokiAssist** aims to:
- Automatically read and summarize PQ reports (.docx, .csv)
- Provide accurate, context-aware answers based on both documents and manuals
- Support both beginner and expert users through guided and flexible interactions
